To the paschal victim

today let us raise
                   Dm
the sacrifice of praise.
Fmaj7                       E
The lamb has redeemed His flock
Dm               Fmaj7
the innocent has reconciled
                   E
us sinners to the Father.
Am         A7
Death and life faced each other
               Dm
in a wondrous duel.
Fmaj7                   E
The author of life was dead,
     Dm         Fmaj7     E
but now He is alive and triumphs.
A7
Tell us Mary:

what did you see on the way?
Dm                      E
«Empty the tomb of the Lord,
      Dm                           E
the Glory of the Lord and Christ alive,
    F                             E
the angels, the shroud and the sudarium.»
