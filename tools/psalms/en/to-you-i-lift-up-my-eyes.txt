Dm                                                           A7
As the eyes of the servants are fixed on the hands of their masters,
Gm                                               A7
as the eyes of a slave girl on the hands of her mistress,
Bb7                     A7
so our eyes are on the Lord,
Bb7                      A7     Bb7                     A7
waiting for Him to have mercy, waiting for Him to have mercy.
