TO YOU, O LORD,
                         Dm
WITH MY VOICE I CRY FOR HELP

TO YOU O LORD,
                     Am
IN MY PLEADING I ENTREAT YOU.
    E7
TO YOU I POUR OUT MY LAMENT,
    F                   E
TO YOU, MY ANGUISH I UNFOLD.

(c
Dm
I feel that my spirit fails;
                 E7
but you know my path.
Am                 Dm
Look Lord, on the way,
                                  Am
look, they have laid a snare for me.
E                                 E7
Look at my right hand there is no one,
   F          E
no one that knows me.
Dm
Every consolation flees from me,
                                      E7
for there is no one who cares for my soul.

TO YOU I CRY, O LORD;

TO YOU I SAY:
                   E7
«YOU ALONE ARE MY REFUGE,
    F
YOU ARE MY LOT ON THIS EARTH,
         E
MY ONLY HAPPINESS!»

Dm                    E
Listen, Lord, to my clamor
   Dm               E
because I am so depressed.
  F                   G
Free me from my enemies
                       E
who are stronger than me!
F                              G
Snatch my soul from this prison,
                                E
and I will give thanks to your name.
F
Then the saints will gather around me,
                                         E
they will rejoice for your love towards me.
