Am                       G
His body, enflamed with love,
                        Am
living bread upon the cross;
                 G
His blood on the altar,
                    Am
chalice of the New Covenant.


                         G
In this paschal vesper sheltered,
                  Am
for the angel of destruction;
                G
we have been delivered
                      Am
from Pharaoh’s harsh dominion.

Innocent, slaughtered lamb
Christ is our Passover;
He, who offered his own body,
is true unleavened bread.

O true and worthy bread
you unlock the gate of hell,
rescue people in fetters
award fullness of life.

(lc
Christ, victoriuos from the abyss,
resurrecting from the tomb,
He subdues with chains the tyrant
restituting Paradise.

Let the paschal Joy, O Jesus
be forever in our souls:
to new life reborn in baptism,
to your victory unite us.
