A. THUS SPEAK THE AMEN,
     C                     D7^
THE FAITHFUL AND TRUTHFUL WITNESS,
THE BEGINNING
                     Em^
OF THE CREATURES OF GOD.

Em^
C. I know your behavior:
    G^
you are neither hot nor cold.
                         D7^
I wish you were cold or hot
         B7^
and not lukewarm,
because I am going
                      Em^
to vomit you from my mouth!

Em^
A. THUS SPEAK THE AMEN …

Em^
C. You say: «I am rich, I lack nothing».
    G^
And you are not aware
               D7^
that you are wretched,
              B7^
worthy of compassion,
                 Em^
poor, blind and naked.

Em^
C. I counsel you to buy from me
                 D7^
gold refined by fire
       B7^
white garments
and eye-salve
                 Em^
so that you may see.

A. THUS SPEAK THE AMEN …

Em^
C. Those I love I correct;
         G             D^
be then zealous and repent,
              B7                  Em^
listen to my voice, listen to my voice.<br>
Behold: I am at the door and knock
                    G^
if anyone hears my voice
               D7^
and opens the door,
                  B7^
I will enter his house
                                 Em^
and I will dine with him and he with me.
