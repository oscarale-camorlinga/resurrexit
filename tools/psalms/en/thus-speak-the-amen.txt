I know your behavior:
    G
you are neither hot nor cold.
                         D7
I wish you were cold or hot
         B7
and not lukewarm,

because I am going
                      Em
to vomit you from my mouth!

You say: «I am rich, I lack nothing».
     G
And you are not aware
               D7
that you are wretched,
              B7
worthy of compassion,
                 Em
poor, blind and naked.

I counsel you to buy from me

gold refined by fire

white garments

and eye-salve
                 Em
so that you may see.

Those I love I correct;
         G             D
be then zealous and repent,
              B7                  Em
listen to my voice, listen to my voice.



Behold: I am at the door and knock
                    G
if anyone hears my voice
               D7
and opens the door,
                  B7
I will enter his house
                                 Em
and I will dine with him and he with me.
